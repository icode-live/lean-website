# lean-website

This is a lean website without necessarily being a single-page project.

It will strive to grown within the constraint of a single main module,
to better understand what happens in a Django project.

Memo to myself:

live project as a personal website to get better feedback for the design and  development process.


Using git 2 behavior::

    git config --global push.default simple


get it on webfaction::

    git clone https://github.com/icode-live/lean-website.git

update on webfaction::

    git pull

push it from yoshiki::

    git push

Don't modify files too often on Webfaction lest you may need this::

	git fetch
	git reset --hard origin/master
